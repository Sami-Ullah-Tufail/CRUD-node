# Node.js CRUD API Project

Welcome to the Node.js CRUD API project! This project aims to demonstrate the creation of a robust API using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. With this API, users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database of users.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new users to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve user information from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing user data in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove users from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing user data.
- **Mongoose:** An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, simplifying interactions with MongoDB.
